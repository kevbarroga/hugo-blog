Hello! I'm Kevin Barroga. I was born and raised in Kapaa, Kauai.

I like learning new things, visiting new places, and good scotch.
I also enjoy [juggling Kettlebells](https://youtu.be/OydQfyc1Xnw).

Currently, I am learning [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web development and I am training for my first marathon.
