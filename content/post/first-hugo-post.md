Finally got around to putting a personal blog site together. Neat thing about it - 
powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and I can use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to author my posts. 
For me, setup was simple and painless compared to ~~Jekyll~~ other static site generators.
