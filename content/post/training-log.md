*Updated September 30, 2017*

I decided to log my runs and workouts, mainly for accountability purposes.
Maybe in 20 years I will look back at this and see moments I've slacked off from training.

Run routes added for 2017 runs. Due to the tedious effort of manually exporting the gpx data for each run from Samsung Health, uploading it to Strava, then generating an embed link, I won't add routes for 2016.

You can view the logs [here](https://www.kevinbarroga.me/tl/).
