I purchased the [Learn Node][node] course early last year, but did not find the time to go through it.
Instead of coming up with a new years resolution, I figured it would be great to start 2018 learning something new.
In the next few days I will start the course and my hope is to regularly post updates on my progress.

As with all Wes' courses, I expect it will be a fun one!

If you want to follow along, keep and eye out on new my posts.
