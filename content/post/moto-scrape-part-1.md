## Introduction

I've been watching MotoGP for about 10 years now, and today it still amazes me that the riders have the ability to comfortably squeeze into their racing leathers with balls the size of theirs.
It's a shame the sport is not hugely popular in the states... How often do you get to see the #1 and #2 athlete compete against one another each week?

This will be a continuing series of the process I took to scrape over 30 years of MotoGP data using python.

Today we will learn how to use the python requests library and the standard json library to fetch JSON data from an URL and parse it.
